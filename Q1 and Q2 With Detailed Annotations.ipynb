Naturally, there are 26 ways this can happen, as there are 26 possible shifts due to the length of the English alphabet. This includes a trivial shift, in which the message is shifted 26 places, and is the same as the unencrypted message. \n",

    "This shifts the character, by the shift value, takes the modulo 26 of that calculation, such that if the character is greater than 26 (Z), it returns the remainder to add to 0 (A). The offset value is then added back to the now encrypted character, and it is transformed from its ASCII value again to the character that it represents.\n",

    "This shifted character is then appended to the encrypted_message list, and this occurs for all alphabetic characters in the message.\n",

The first character of the keyword is found, and set to be the first letter of the alphabet, and all characters follow in order. i.e, if the first letter were to be \"R\", the shifted alphabet would be R,S,T,U...Z,A,B,...Q. We then find the position in the  standard alphabet of the first character of the message, and take this positional index and encrypt the character by selecting the letter of the same index in the shifted alphabet.

    "## Breaking The Caesar Cypher\n",
    "\n",
    "To break the Caesar Cypher, we use frequency analysis to determine the most frequent letter in the encrypted message, and cross reference this with the list of most frequent characters in the english language. Then using that, iterate through each most frequent letter, starting with the most common \"E\" and use that as a reference for our shift value. Continue until the message looks like plaintext, and the message is decrypted, and the Cypher is broken. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a large enough message size, this function should always work on the first attempt, as \"E\" will be the most frequent letter in almost every large text file. However, this may not always be the case, hence we do iterate through each most common letter until plaintext is received. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start as usual, by prompting the user asking for which file they would like to be decrypted, using the find_file function. This is then opened and read to the variable cryptic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decrypted_text file is then opened to be written to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The descending_frequent_letters file is opened, read, and turned into a list and stored in frequency_list. This is the list of frequent letters generated by the large text from novels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Breaking Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by finding the letter which appears most frequently in the encrypted text. This is done using the frequency_finder function, and that letter is stored to message_most_frequent. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we set correctness to False. This is to allow the function to continue running until the encrypted message hasbeen decrypted correctly, and plaintext is visible. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a while loop, while correctness is false, we essentially perform Caesar Decryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterating through the letters in the most frequent letters list, frequency_list, we start Caesar Decryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decrypted_message list is defined, to append our decrypted letters to. \n",
    "\n",
    "The shift value is then calculated, by taking the ASCII value of the most frequent letter in the message, and subtracting the ASCII value of the current letter in the frequency list indexed by i, our iterator. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, iterating through each character in cryptic, we first check if the character is alphabetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "If so, it is then checked whether or not it is uppercase or lowercase, and an appropriate offset value is set. 65 for uppercase, and 97 for lowercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ASCII value of the character is then offset, to set it to be within the range of 0 to 25, for ease of calculation, and stored to the variable character_offset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decryption then happens via this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\text{character_offset} - \\text{shift_value}) mod26 + \\text{offset}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is then appended to the decrypted_message list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all of the characters have been iterated through, the decrypted_message list is joined together as a string, and printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user is then prompted and asked whether the message looks like plaintext or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "If so, correctness is set to false, and we break out of the for loop. This ends the while loop and the decrypted message is written to the decrypted_text file, and the user is shown a message confirming this.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the message does not look like plaintext, the loop continues, using the next most frequent letter. \n",
    "\n",
    "After plaintext is found, the files are closed. \n",
